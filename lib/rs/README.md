# Rust Thrift library

## Overview

 This crate implements the components required to build a working
 Thrift server and client. It is divided into the following modules:

 1. errors
 2. protocol
 3. transport
 4. server
 5. autogen

 The modules are layered as shown. The `generated` layer is code
 generated by the Thrift compiler's Rust plugin. It uses the components
 defined in this crate to serialize and deserialize types and implement
 RPC. Users interact with these types and services by writing their own
 code on top.
