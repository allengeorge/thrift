//! Rift: Thrift implementation library for Rust.
//!
//! This crate provides implementations for the layers
//! required to build a working Thrift server and client.
//! It is divided into the following modules:
//! 1. errors
//! 2. protocol
//! 3. transport
//! 4. server
//!
//! Please see each module for detailed information on that module.
//!
//! At a high level these modules are layered as shown below,
//! with the app code generated by the Thrift compiler and exposing
//! a high-level interface using the error and result types
//! defined in this crate.
//!
//! ```text
//! +-----------+
//! |    app    | <-> errors/results
//! +-----------+
//! |  protocol |
//! +-----------+
//! | transport |
//! +-----------+
//! ```
